			<h1>So... what even is a game jam?</h1>
			<p>I've been asked this question many, many times!
				Which sort of makes sense: people say "Come to the hackathon!"
				or "Hey, why not sign up for this cool game jam thing?" without 
				actually telling you what a game jam is or what you're going to be doing on the day.
				So fair enough if you're confused! Luckily, it's really simple:
			</p>
			<h3 style="text-decoration: underline; padding-left:5vw; padding-right:5vw">
				A game jam is an event where you form teams 
				and make a video game over the course of the day.
			</h3>
			<p>Yep, that's it. Daydream will essentially be a day where you 
				get into a bunch of teams, make friends, make a game you're proud of, share that game to the world, and have 
				a whole lot of fun :). There's a simple schedule on <a href="daydream.hackclub.com/cambridge">
				the main event website</a> but if you want one in more detail, here it is:
			</p>
		</div>
		<div id="schedule", class="text-section">
			<h3>
				8:45-9:10: Registration
			</h3>
			<p>This is the bit where all of you are going to come to 
				the venue (<a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/BboLuXMJbDvNGGYj7">The Raspberry Pi Foundation
				on Hills Road - NOT the shop!</a>), 
				and one of us on the organising team are going to help you
				get registered. Once we've confirmed you're on the signups list, 
				we'll let you into the main building and you can choose somewhere
				to sit down. WE WILL NOT LET YOU IN IF YOU'RE NOT SIGNED UP 
				OR DON'T HAVE THE WAIVER FILLED IN! Make sure you get this done!</p>
			<h3>
				9:10-10:00: Setup and Opening Ceremony
			</h3>
			<p>
				Once everyone's sat down and settled, we'll give a short opening presentation
				where all of the organisers and our lovely adult volunteers! We'll give you
				a rundown of what's happening on the day and all of the important stuff you will need
				to know. We'll also reveal the theme for the games, and then you'll get yourself
				into teams of 2-3 people! It's completely fine if you don't know others who are coming,
				hackathons are always great with friends (and it's not too late to get them to sign up!) 
				but lots of people make teams with people they don't know!
			</p>
			<h3>
				10:00-13:00: Start working on your projects!
			</h3>
			<p>
				This is the bit where you will get cracking on your project! We'll also run a workshop in this bit, 
				where I'll be showing those who are less confident with game dev how to make a platformer game
				in <a href="https://godotengine.org/">Godot</a>, which they can then expand to make their own games!
				Everyone who joins in with the workshop will also get some cool free stuff!
			</p>
			<h3>
				13:00-14:00: Lunch
			</h3>
			<p>
				Yum. We'll also be running a little video call with some other daydream events, so 
				make sure not to miss that!
			</p>
			<h3>
				15:00-15:30: Talk by Learn Anything founder
			</h3>
			<p>We'll be getting a super inspiring talk by the founder of 
				<a href="https://www.learnanything.com/">Learn Anything</a>: it's 
				a great opportunity to learn from a really awesome person who
				does the kinds of things you guys might want to do in the future!
			</p>
			<h3>
				15:30-18:00: More projects stuff :)
			</h3>
			<p> More time to work on your project and make it really super awesome!</p>
			<h3>
				18:00-19:00: Dinner
			</h3>
			<p>Double yum. Our dinner will be courtesy of 
				<a href="https://www.aromi.co.uk/">Aromi's</a> generosity,
			so it's sure to be absolutely ðŸ”¥</p>
			<h3>
				19:00-20:30: Ship your project and vote!
			</h3>
			<p>EVERYONE. MUST. SHIP. This is the bit where we share your project
				to the world (and to hack club) by submitting it to <a href="https://itch.io">itch</a>. 
				If you don't submit your project, you won't get a super cool daydream shirt (no exceptions, we're
				sorry but we have to do this!). So we are ALL GOING TO SHIP. 
				We'll be using <a href="https://podium.hackclub.com">podium</a> to vote, you all will get
				to vote on a winning team, who will get an awesome prize!
			</p>
			<h3>20:30-20:45: Winners and closing ceremony</h3>
			<p>We'll do a short wrap-up presentation and then we'll let you all go home!</p>
