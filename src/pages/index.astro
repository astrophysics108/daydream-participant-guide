			<h1>So... what even is a game jam?</h1>
			<p>I've been asked this question many, many times!
				Which sort of makes sense: people say "Come to the hackathon!"
				or "Hey, why not sign up for this cool game jam thing?" without 
				actually telling you what a game jam is or what you're going to be doing on the day.
				So fair enough if you're confused! Luckily, it's really simple:
			</p>
			<h3 style="text-decoration: underline; padding-left:5vw; padding-right:5vw">
				A game jam is an event where you form teams 
				and make a video game over the course of the day.
			</h3>
			<p>Yep, that's it. Daydream will essentially be a day where you 
				get into a bunch of teams, make friends, make a game you're proud of, share that game to the world, and have 
				a whole lot of fun :). There's a simple schedule on <a href="daydream.hackclub.com/cambridge">
				the main event website</a> but if you want one in more detail, here it is:
			</p>

		<div id="schedule", class="text-section">
			<h3>
				8-45-9am: Registration
			</h3>
			<p>This is the bit where all of you are going to come to 
				the venue (<a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/BboLuXMJbDvNGGYj7">The Raspberry Pi Foundation
				on Hills Road - NOT the shop!</a>), 
				and one of us on the organising team are going to help you
				get registered. Once we've confirmed you're on the signups list, 
				we'll let you into the main building and you can choose somewhere
				to sit down. WE WILL NOT LET YOU IN IF YOU'RE NOT SIGNED UP 
				OR DON'T HAVE THE WAIVER FILLED IN! Make sure you get this done!</p>
